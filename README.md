## Classes

* dhcp
* dhcp::server

### dhcp

The `dhcp` class is a wrapper around `dhcp::server`:

    include ::dhcp

### dhcp::server

Installs a DHCP server:

     class { 'dhcp::server':
       opts => ['domain-name "toto.ltd"',
                'domain-name-servers 192.168.21.1'],
     }

## Definitions

* dhcp::hosts
* dhcp::shared\_network
* dhcp::subnet
* dhcp::failover

### dhcp::hosts

Creates a DHCP configuration for the given hosts:

    dhcp::hosts { 'workstations':
      subnet    => '192.168.1.0',
       'hash_data' => {
         'host1' => {
           'interfaces' => {
             'eth0'  => '00:11:22:33:44:55',
             'wlan0' => '00:aa:bb:44:55:ff',
           },
         },
         'host2' => {
           'interfaces' => {
             'eth1'  => '00:11:af:33:44:55',
           },
           'fixed_address' => 'foo.example.com',
           'options'        => ['opt1'],
         },
       },
    }

### dhcp::shared\_network

Creates a shared-network entry:

    dhcp::shared_network { 'office':
      subnets => ['192.168.1.0', '192.168.2.0'],
    }

### dhcp::subnet

Creates a subnet:

    dhcp::subnet {"10.27.20.0":
      ensure     => present,
      broadcast  => "10.27.20.255",
      other_opts => ['filename "pxelinux.0";', 'next-server 10.27.10.1;'],
    }

## dhcp::failover

Creates a failover peer:

    dhcp::failover {'my-failover-peer':
      ensure       => present,
      peer_address => '1.2.3.4',
      options      => {
        'max-response-delay'       => 30,
        'max-unacked-updates'      => 10,
        'load balance max seconds' => 3,
        'mclt'                     => 1800,
        'split'                    => 128,
      }
    }
    dhcp::subnet {"10.27.20.0":
      ensure     => present,
      broadcast  => "10.27.20.255",
      other_opts => [
        'pool {',
        'failover peer "my-failover-peer";',
        'max-lease-time 1800;',
        'range 10.27.20.100 10.27.20.250;',
